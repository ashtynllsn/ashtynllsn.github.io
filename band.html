                <h2>More About Band</h2>
                <p>While I was definetly involved in many differnet 
                    things when I went to high school the thing that
                    I spent the most time doing was band. Being in band 
                    helped develop my confidence in myself and teamwork 
                    skills. Not to mention I left with the pretty cool 
                    skill of being able to play the trumpet. I was in band 
                    for a total of eight years and loved all of it. I don't 
                    know if I can confidently say that I would have enjoyed
                    high school as much as I did if it weren't for band. 
                    To the right you should be able to see a video of my very
                    first year of marching band.</p>
